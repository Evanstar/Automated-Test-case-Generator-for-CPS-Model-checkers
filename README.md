# Automated-Test-case-Generator-for-CPS-Model-checkers
A CPS (Cyber-Physical-Systems) model checker is a software which can analyse mathematical models of CPS for property verification. Interesting properties can be in regards to safety, stability,etc of CPS. Model-checkers are themselves software which needs to be sufficiently tested. In this project, the aim is to build an automated test-case generator for CPS model-checkers. The generator should attempt to create test-cases which can make existing model-checkers to fail.
