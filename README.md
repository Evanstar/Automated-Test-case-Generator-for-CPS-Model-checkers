# Automated-Test-case-Generator-for-CPS-Model-checkers

A CPS model checker is a software which can analyse mathematical models of CPS for property verification. Interesting properties can be in regards to safety, stability,etc of CPS. Model-checkers are themselves software which needs to be sufficiently tested. In this project, the aim is to build an automated test-case generator for CPS model-checkers. The generator should attempt to create test-cases which can make existing model-checkers to fail.

 SpaceEx is a platform for developing reachability and safety verication algorithms for hybrid automata models of CPS. Many model checking algorithms have already been implemented in SpaceEx and it accepts model in a XML file format.
